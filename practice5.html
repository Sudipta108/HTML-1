        <b>Hyderabad amassed 277-3, setting a new record for the highest team total – not only in the IPL but in all domestic T20s.<br> The previous IPL record was Royal Challenger Bangalore’s (now Bengaluru) 263-5 in 2013,<br> while in any franchise cricket, Melbourne Stars’ 273-2 in 2021/22 used to be the best.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong> SRH had never hit more than 13 sixes in an innings.<br> In their first match of 2024 against the Kolkata Knight Riders, they hit 15, and against MI, they improved on that with 18.<br> Mumbai Indians responded with 20 sixes, the joint second-most in IPL history, after RCB’s 21 when they had amassed 263-5.<br> RCB had also hit 20 in 2016 while Delhi Daredevils (now Capitals) had done so in 2017, both against the now-defunct Gujarat Lions.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>
            <i>That took the tally in the SRH-MI clash to 38 – a new record for most sixes in a T20.<br> The previous record was 37 (Balkh Legends 23, Kabul Zwanan 14 in Afghan Premier League 2018/19;<br> Jamaica Tallawahs 21, St Kitts and Nevis Patriots 16 in CPL 2019). The previous IPL record was 33 in three different matches, in 2018, 2020, and 2023.</i>

        <strong><em>The basic premise of cricket says that a wicket is a good result for the bowling side, right? Sai Kishore, however, found out otherwise at Chepauk on Tuesday (March 27) when he dismissed Ajinkya Rahane. Next in at No.4 was Shivam Dube. Against a left-arm spinner, with the score reading 104-2 in the eleventh over that had five balls remaining, Dube had the license to go for the kill.<br>
        Sai Kishore’s response suggested that he knew that. He darted one well outside off at a three-quarter length, the go-to defensive option for spinners in limited overs cricket. But Dube’s six-foot-four frame helped him get underneath it regardless, and the ball flew like a zooming missile over long-on.</strong></em>
